== teamcity-client

Team City Ghetto HTTP client.

Authentication is not yet supported and therefore guest access is
required.

Currently supports retrieving the number of new build errors for
a given build.

Initialize with a host:port string for grabbing and parsing pages
in the Team City interface.
